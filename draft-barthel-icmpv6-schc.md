ICMPv6 is companion protocol for IPv6 to configure hosts in the network, inform of errors 
during packet 
delivery and provide a basic device management with the ping command. 
-->

This document decribes
how to adapt ICMPv6 as defined in {{rfc4443}} to LPWAN using SCHC header compression mechanism
and how to protect the LPWAN network and device from ICMP traffic.

# Introduction 

{{rfc4443}} specify ICMPv6 and define a generic message format used either to inform 
the source of errors during packet delivery or by applications for simple host 
configuration or management.

{{rfc4443}} defines 4 error messages: Destination Unreachable, Packet Too Big, 
Time Exceeded and Parameter Problem. Echo Request and Echo Reply are also defined in 
this RFC to support the ping program. Other message type, such as for Neighbor Discovery
Protocol {{rfc4861}} are defined in other RFC. 

This document focus on the compression of {{rfc4443}} messages over a LPWAN network.

In the LPWAN architecture different
scenarii can be exhibited:

* the device is the source of an ICMP message, mainly in response to a incorrect IPv6
message, or to a ping resquest. In that case, the device should be protected from this 
traffic and the core SCHC C/D should act as a proxy to avoid unwanted traffic on the LPWAN.

<!--
* the device is the destination of the ICMP message, mainly in response to a 
packet sent on the network generating an error message. This document describes in
section XXXX on compression can be defined. The device can

* the device is the destination of the ICMP message, mainly in response to a
packet sent by the device to the network that generates an error message. This document describes in
section XXXX the compression to be applied.



# Device as a source of ICMPv6 message

As stated in {{rfc4443}}, a node should generate an ICMPv6 message in response to an
IPv6 packet that is malformed or which cannot be processed due to some incorrect field value.


The intent of this document is to spare both the End-Device and the LPWAN network this un-necessary traffic.
The incorrect packets should be caught at the core SCHC C/D and the ICMPv6 notification should be sent back from there.

{: #Fig-ICMPv6-up title='Example of ICMPv6 error message sent back to the Internet'}

{{Fig-ICMPv6-up}} shows an example of an IPv6 packet trying to reach a device. The port used
as destination is not known from the core SCHC C/D. Instead of sending the packet over
the LPWAN and having this packet rejected by the End-Device, the core SCHC C/D issues
an ICMPv6 error message "Destination Unreachable" on behalf of the End-Device.

# Device is the destination of the ICMPv6 message

An End-Device may be configured to send information to a server periodically. If this
server is not accessible on the network, an ICMPv6 message will be generated by a router.
This information can be useful to the End-Device, for example to reduce the transmission
period.

{: #Fig-ICMPv6-down title='Example of ICMPv6 error message sent back to the End-Device'}

{{Fig-ICMPv6-down}} illustrates this behavior. The ICMPv6 message will contain "As much 
of invoking packet as possible" as stated by RFC 4443. If there is enough information to
find the rule which has been used to uncompress the erroneous packet, its rule id will be
sent in the compressed ICMPv6 message.

A SHCH rule must also be defined to compress the ICMPv6 header.

# ping management

If a ping request is generated by an End-Device, then SCHC compression rules apply. If the
device is the destination of the ping request, the default behavior is to avoid
sending the ping request over the LPWAN. Three behavior can be defined, with the code value
being used to distinguish them:

* code = 0, the SCHC C/D answer on the behalt of the device if a rule regarding the 
IPv6 address of the device is found.

* code = 1, the SCHC C/D queries the NGW (or maintains a local database) and answers with
the number of seconds since the End-Device last transmission.

* code =  2, the SCHC C/D compresses the ICMPv6 message and forwards it to the End-Device.

{: #Fig-ICMP-error title='ICMPv6 Error Message'}

Type can take the values between 1 and 4, code can be set between 0 and 6. Value is
unused for Destination Unreachable and Time exceed message. It contains the MTU for
Packet Too Big and a pointer on the byte causing the error for Parameter error message. 
Therefore this value should not be higher than 1280 bytes in LPWAN networks.

The following generic rule can be used to compress ICMPv6 messages. Some more specific
rules can also be defined. 

Type field can be associated to a matching list [1, 2, 3, 4] which be compressed into 2 
bits. Code can be reduced to 3 bits using LSB CDF. Value can be set to 11 bits using LSB 
CDF, but if the device is known to send smaller packets, then the size of this field can
be reduced.

The rest of the ICMPv6 message contains the beginning of the message that have generated
this ICMPv6 error message. This information can be used to identify the SCHC rule that
was used to decompress the erroneous packet. If the rule has been found then the rule id 
can be added at the end of the compressed ICMPv6 message. Otherwise the compressed 
packet ends after the compressed value field.
